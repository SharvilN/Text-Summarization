Valerie Plame Wilson is a former CIA officer who worked to stop spread of nuclear materials.
She says nuclear weapons and terrorism represent No. 1 threat faced right now.
Plame says nations need to reduce nuclear arsenals and tightly control materials.
If governments don't act now, we will witness use of a bomb in our lifetime, she says.
