3 teens killed Saturday at a car dealership in Ciudad Juarez, a spokesman says.
One of the victims is a U.S. citizen, the late boy's parents told Mexican authorities.
An El Paso, Texas, high school honors another of the victims Monday on its website.
Ciudad Juarez has been beset by severe violence in recent months.
