NEW: John White says of his sentence being commuted: "It's a blessed day".
Gov. Paterson said he wanted to lessen the suffering after "this tragic event".
John White shot Daniel Cicciaro in 2006 during an altercation at his home.
The shooting stemmed from a dispute between White's son and a group of white youths.
