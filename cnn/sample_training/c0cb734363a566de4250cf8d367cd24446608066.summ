Sanaria Inc. is developing a malaria vaccine that uses the whole parasite.
Concept is akin to live virus vaccines, such as those for polio and measles.
The method had been tried in the 1970s but wasn't feasible on mass scale.
The most advanced malaria vaccine, by GlaxoSmithKline, has been tested in Africa.
