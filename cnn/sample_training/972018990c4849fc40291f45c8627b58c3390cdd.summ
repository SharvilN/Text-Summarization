Chris Farrell: "We can't afford early retirement" is alarmist; there's no Social Security crisis.
Farrell says public and private pensions depend on economy's 2 percent steady growth.
Mandating older retirement is a step backward, he writes. Wealthy societies don't do that.
The goal should be giving people freedom of choice in the last third of life, Farrell says.
