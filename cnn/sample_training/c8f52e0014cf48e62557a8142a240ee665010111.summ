Rep. Edward Markey calls for BP to prove claim of no underwater oil plumes.
Markey also says BP must provide more information on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Markey is head of the House Energy and Environment subcommittee.
BP CEO Tony Hayward said Sunday all the spilled oil was rising to the surface.
