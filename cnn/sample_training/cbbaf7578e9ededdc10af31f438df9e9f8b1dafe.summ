Pilot Joe Cabuk went unconscious at the controls during a flight from Florida.
"I said, 'Joe! Joe!' and that's when his head rolled over to the side," Doug White says.
White says, "The only thing I knew how to do up there was talk on the radio".
Air traffic controllers helped White safely land plane carrying his wife and 2 daughters.
