Kenneth Biros was convicted of killing and dismembering a 22-year-old woman in 1991.
He was executed Tuesday using a new, untested one-drug method of lethal injection.
His attorney objected to the method, saying it was unconstitutional.
The U.S. Supreme Court without comment denied a request to stay the execution.
