Robert Rogers' wife and four children died in flash flood five years ago.
Rogers chose not to "wallow in pity" and became a minister with a message of hope.
His mission is to establish five orphanages in five continents to honor his family.
One named after his wife, Melissa, exists in Russia, another planned in Rwanda.
