British pensioner Ethel Kendall left the UK in 1986 to be closer to her family in Canada.
24 years later, she is still receiving the same pension of just over Â£38 ($58) a week.
After a European Court of Human Rights ruling she is not likely to receive any more.
Over half a million British expatriates' pensions are not linked to inflation.
