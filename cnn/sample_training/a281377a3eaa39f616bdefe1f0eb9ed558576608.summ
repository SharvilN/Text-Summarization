Gary Amaya was shot and killed Saturday while trying to rob an Illinois tanning salon.
Police say the gun Amaya used matches that in two shootings.
In those, a gunman killed one and wounded three near the Illinois-Indiana line.
That gunman reportedly asked his victims about bees; police say Amaya tended bees.
