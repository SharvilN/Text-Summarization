Former world No.1 Justine Henin confirms her retirement from tennis for the second time.
The 28-year-old Belgian quits after failing to recover from an elbow injury.
Henin sustained the elbow injury during last year's Wimbledon tournament.
She was top of the world rankings for two years and won seven grand slam titles.
