Provincial govt. struck permanent cease-fire with Taliban in Swat Valley Saturday.
Establishment of strict Islamic law in the region is key to the agreement.
Swat Valley was once one of Pakistan's biggest tourist destinations.
Central govt. launched an intense military offensive against militants in late July.
